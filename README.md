# Summer Research
Included are three files: "ES499 Report FINAL.pdf", "gcml.4aug21.pdf" and "gcmlexp.zip".
The first file is the report submitted to Clarkson University detailing the process of my research.
The second, my co-authored IEEE paper published as 
"Pulmonary Disease Classification Using Globally Correlated Maximum Likelihood: an Auxiliary Attention mechanism for Convolutional Neural Networks"
The final is a zip file containing the actual code I used for testing and training.
